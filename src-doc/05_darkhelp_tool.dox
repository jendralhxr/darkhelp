/** @page Tool %DarkHelp Tool

The %DarkHelp library also comes with a tool that uses the %DarkHelp C++ API and shows the results on the screen.

You can load a neural network and browse through a large set of images as you examine the results of calling @ref DarkHelp::predict() and @ref DarkHelp::annotate() on each image.  Images can be resized, apply different thresholds to the predictions, and get details on the predicted results.

Here is an example of how to use it:

~~~~{.sh}
DarkHelp barcodetest.cfg barcodetest_final.weights barcodetest.names test_image_1.jpg test_image_2.jpg
~~~~

Note the parameters:

@li The `.cfg` file used to originally train the neural network.
@li The `.weights` file that was created as part of the neural network training.
@li The `.names` file which contains the names of the various classes in the network.
@li One or more image file (typically `.jpg`, but could be any type of image) against which you want to run the network.

There are at least a dozen possible command-line arguments.  run `%DarkHelp --help` for the full list.  Some examples:

~~~~{.sh}
# -b means resize the "before" input image prior to calling DarkHelp::predict()
# -t sets the new lower bound threshold to 25%
DarkHelp -b 800x800 -t 0.25 barcodetest.cfg barcodetest_final.weights barcodetest.names *.jpg

# -a resizes the "after" output image once DarkHelp::annotate() has been called
# -s starts the viewer in slideshow mode, where a new image is loaded every second
DarkHelp -a 640x480 -s barcodetest.cfg barcodetest_final.weights barcodetest.names *.jpg
~~~~

In addition to command-line arguments, there are several keys you can use in the viewer.  They are:

@li @p q or @p ESC to exit from the viewer.
@li @p w to write the current image to disk in the current working directory (see @p "output.png")
@li @p HOME to return to the first image in the data set
@li @p END to skip to the last image in the data set
@li @p LEFT go to the previous image
@li @p UP increase the rate at which images are processed during the slideshow
@li @p DOWN decrease the rate at which images are processed during the slideshow
@li @p PAGE-UP increase the threshold
@li @p PAGE-DOWN decrease the threshold
@li @p g to toggle greyscale images
@li @p p to pause or play the slideshow
