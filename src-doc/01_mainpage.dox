/** @mainpage %DarkHelp

The official web site for C Code Run's %DarkHelp is http://www.ccoderun.ca/. <br/>

This documentation is available here:
@li http://www.ccoderun.ca/DarkHelp/api/
@li https://www.ccoderun.ca/programming/2019-08-25_Darknet_C_CPP/

Source code for %DarkHelp is available at http://www.ccoderun.ca/download/. <br/>

@note %DarkHelp is @em not Darknet!  %DarkHelp is a C++ API layer used to call Darknet's original C API.

I recommend AlexeyAB's popular fork of Darknet, available at https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet.  %DarkHelp was specifically written for and tested against AlexeyAB's fork.

The original author of the Darknet neural network framework is <a target="_blank" href="https://pjreddie.com/darknet/">Joseph Redmon</a>.  I have not tested %DarkHelp against that version of Darknet since it hasn't been updated in several years, and I consider it to be abandoned.
